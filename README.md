# MD5FixPointSearch
A simple java program that attempts to find a fix point for the MD5 function.
It will try find a maximum prefix/suffix match.

Input parameter is number of threads and it will default to 7 threads. 

So record so far is a 12 character prefix and also 12 character suffix match:

suffix 12: df12c1434cec7850a7900ce027af4b78 -> b2f6053087022898fe920ce027af4b78

prefix 12: 54db1011d76dc70a0a9df3ff3e0b390f -> 54db1011d76d137956603122ad86d762

You are welcome to contact me if you find an improvement to the two above matches.
